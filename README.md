# Tkinter_Calculator
Tkinter Calculator is a simple Python-based desktop application built using the Tkinter library. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a user-friendly graphical interface.
This program implements a simple calculator using Python’s Tkinter module.
The calculator provides a graphical user interface where users can enter numbers and operators using buttons instead of typing from the keyboard.

Each button click updates the display area using an Entry widget. The calculator supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The Clear button is used to remove all input, while the Backspace button deletes the last entered character.

When the Equals (=) button is pressed, the program evaluates the entered expression and displays the result. If the expression is incorrect or cannot be calculated, an error message is shown. The layout is designed using the grid system to make the interface simple and easy to use.
